poem = """So a little about me?
I am i my early 20s as at 2022.
I stated the year above because, who knows which year any of you is going to see this codes/repo
I have just a BSc in Information Technology at the moment.
At the moment because, i will be going for my masters, then my phd or maybe a second masters who knows lol.
I am a mental health activist as well.
A little advise, Don't stress about anything in life, it will either workout perfectly well or the other option will be far better than what you expected.
I love you and never settle for less."""
#To create multiple lines with each on a new line, use the triple quote """
